# premier-league-point-table-prediction
This project aims to predict the total points for football teams in a season using historical performance data. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, the model analyzes various team statistics, such as goals, assists, possession metrics, and more, to forecast league standings accurately

KEY FEATURES:
1.Multi-Model Evaluation: Trained and evaluated seven different regression models:
   K-Nearest Neighbors
   Decision Tree Regressor
   Random Forest Regressor
   AdaBoost Regressor
   Gradient Boosting Regressor
  XGBoost Regressor
  CatBoost Regressor
2.High Accuracy: Achieved a model accuracy of 96% using the XGBoost Regressor, based on the R² score metric.
3.Season Predictions: Predicts the total points for teams in the ongoing 2024 season by considering matches already played and forecasting remaining performance.
4.Data Sources: Utilizes comprehensive datasets covering multiple seasons, including detailed match statistics, player contributions, and team performances.

MODEL PERFORMANCE:
The XGBoost Regressor outperformed other models, achieving a 96% accuracy (R² score), making it a robust choice for predicting football league outcomes. This model leverages a mix of ensemble learning and boosting techniques, allowing for high predictive power even with complex feature interactions.

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
Integration of player-level statistics for more granular predictions.
Implementation of deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, RNN) for time-series forecasting.
Building a web dashboard to visualize predictions and season progress in real-time.
